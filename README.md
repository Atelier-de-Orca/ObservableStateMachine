> Model based Observable State Machine with UniRx
  
## üìñ Introduction
- It is useful if you have presets of state that an object can have.  
- `Presenter`'s behaviour is written as one, and transition(between pre-defined status models) is notified to the stream to help `Presenter`'s behaviour.  
- `pre-defined state model` can contain data to show on `View` or variables for `Presenter's action` (even simple actions such as Skill)
